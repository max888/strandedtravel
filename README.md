# Stranded Travel

This app is being created as my final project on the December 2013 - March 2014
intake of General Assembly's Web Development Immersive course.

It is an app aimed towards young travelers aiming to get the best local information on destinations they plan to visit.

Users are asked to give a short description of the destination. Data is then pulled in using Twitter, Instagram and Google Maps API's to provide further information and visuals relevant to the target audience. 

The aim is to strike a balance between inspiration and information.

I welcome all feedback so please get in touch with any suggestions :)
